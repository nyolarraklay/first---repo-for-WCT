    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are a lot of potential threats to your website caused by web security attacks. Such these will allow the hackers to log – into password-protected areas, configure the server, and upload codes that will grant the attackers easy access to your website. Such breaches could result in identity or financial fraud. Consequence range from loss of private account passwords to loss of credit card details. These threats are preventable, to improve the security of your website, you should always sanitize all user–originating data before it is displayed in the browser, and make sure to replace powerful characters with harmless equivalents or add escape characters before powerful characters. Render every single quote in the data harmless by putting a backslash in front of it. This way you can avoid code injections (SQL Injections, JS injections, etc). Regulating POST and GET request input will also help to prevent attacks. Make sure your application accepts only the request method you expect and ignores all others. The next step is to apply these password recommendations, 1. Use a long, complex password. 2. Never re-use a password, 3. Use a password manager, 4. Use a multi-factor authenticator. When displaying credit card information, only store and display data that you need, only display enough of the card number that it can be identified by the user, not enough that it can be copied by an attacker and used on another site. For example, displaying only the last 4 digits of the credit card number. Lastly is to configure your web server to use HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts data sent between you and your server. This ensures that login credentials, cookies POST request data, and header information are not easily available to attackers.</p>
